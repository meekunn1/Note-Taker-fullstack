# Note-Taker-fullstack

## Description

This app is for reading, creating, and deleting notes. This app uses server and json database to so notes can be accessed from anywhere. Working on this project allowed me to practice creating server using express.js. This project also allowed me to practice deploying apps through [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
